EventTracker is a mobile application designed to help users easily manage their events and stay organized. This app was created to address the user’s need for an efficient and centralized platform to track, add, delete, and get notified about upcoming events. EventTracker aims to make event management less stressful for individuals with busy schedules.

To meet the user's needs, EventTracker features screens and functionalities for user authentication (login and signup), event creation, event deletion, and push notifications. These features were carefully designed to provide a seamless user experience and are easily accessible through a simple, intuitive UI.
I focused on clean, easy-to-read designs that enable users to complete tasks quickly and efficiently. EventTracker’s UI uses a combination of familiar icons, readable fonts, and consistent color schemes to guide users through the app's various functionalities. This thoughtful design approach proved successful in creating an intuitive and enjoyable user experience.

During the coding process, we followed a systematic approach, starting with creating the necessary data models and UI layouts, followed by developing the core functionalities such as user authentication, event creation and deletion, and push notifications.

To ensure the code was functional and to identify any potential bugs, I performed both manual and automated testing. Additionally, I tested the app's functionality manually on multiple devices to confirm its performance and responsiveness in various scenarios.

One significant challenge was implementing a reliable and responsive notification system that would alert users about upcoming events even when the app was closed or running in the background.
To overcome this challenge, we used a combination of background tasks and push notifications, ensuring that notifications would consistently work regardless of the app's state. This innovative approach resulted in a robust and effective notification system.
